"""
Shared L1/L2/L3 terminology for underwater acoustic classification.

This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for:
  - L3_PRECISE:  pipeline QA generation terms (archive/pipeline_step2_qa.py,
                 archive/pipeline_ship_step2_qa.py)
  - L3_SHOULD:   scorer evaluation terms (testsite/core/scorer.py)
  - L1/L2 descriptive terms for T3 reasoning generation

When terminology changes, update ONLY this file — all consumers re-import.

Two-tier design:
  - L3_PRECISE:  accurate observable concepts for each class
  - L3_SHOULD:   expanded synonym set used by the reasoning scorer

SFT rationales are built by build_l3_evidence(), which conditions directional
and ship-noise descriptions on each sample's saved metadata.
